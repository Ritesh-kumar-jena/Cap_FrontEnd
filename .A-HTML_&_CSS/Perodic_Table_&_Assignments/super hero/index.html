            <p>
                Shiva (or Siva) is one of the most important gods in the <br> Hindu pantheon and, along with Brahma and Vishnu, is considered a <br> member of the holy trinity (trimurti) of Hinduism. A complex character, he may represent goodness, benevolence and serve as the Protector but he also has a darker side as the leader of evil spirits, ghosts and vampires and as the master of thieves, villains and beggars. He is also associated with Time, and particularly as the destroyer of all things. Nevertheless, Shiva is also associated with creation. <br>
